# DEMO SITE

## About the project

This project was pretty fun to do, because for the first time I used Sass for styling, even though i have never used it bofore, therefore the code and the structure may not be written correctly. For state management I would have preferred drilling props through components over redux: project was small enough to trace data flow even with vanilla React tools. If I had more time, I would have made added more features to this project (also started to learn React testing tools).
